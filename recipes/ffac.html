        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>Doctor Who tucked into the weird combination of frozen fish fingers and ready-made custard. Thankfully in this recipe, a rich cheese sauce takes the place of custard for dipping your delicious homemade fish fingers.</p>

        <h2>><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>14-oz piece skinned and boned cod or haddock fillet</li>
            <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 medium egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups fresh breadcrumbs oil, for shallow-frying</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

        <h4><em>FOR THE "CUSTARD": </em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 3/4 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard scant</li>
            <li>1 packed cup sharp</li>
            <li>Cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>good pinch of ground turmeric</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

        <h2>><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the fish across into 3/4-inch wide fingers. Put the flour on a plate and season with a little salt and pepper. Put the egg on another plate and the breadcrumbs on a third. Dust the fish in the flour, then coat in beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>For the custard, melt the butter in a small pan. Add the flour and cook over a gentle heat, stirring for 1 minute. Remove the heat and gradually blend in the milk, whisking until smooth. Return to a gente heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the sauce is thickened and smooth. Add the mustard, cheese and turmeric and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Heat a 1/2-inch depth of oil in a frying pan. Once hot enough (a sprinkling of breadcrumbs should sizzle when added to the pan), cook half the fishfingers for 4-5 minutes, turning once until golden. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels and keep warm while you cook the remainder.</li>
            <li>Reheat the cheese sauce gently and serve with the fishfingers.</li>
        </ol>
