        <h1><u>Ood Head Bread:</u></h1>

        <img src="https://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ood-head-bread.jpg" width = 895 alt ="Ingredients of 'Ood Head Bread', a recipe inspired by the Doctor Who universe.">

        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>This Ood might look rather revolting with their squidlike tendrils, but they can be delicious in bread form if properly baked. This is a fun family bread to make-- mildly spiced and tomatoey at one end and plain at the other. Don't worry too much about the shaping. If you get the eyes, ears, and tendrils in the right place, it ll look incredibly "Ood" like. If you've any dough leftover, shape it into balls and bake as mini bread rolls. Like most breads, this one freezes well too if you're planning a Doctor Who party and want to get ahead. Then all you need for you party are a few obliging Oods to hand out the drinks.</p>

        <h2>><u>Ingredients</u></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>7 cups strongs white blead flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
            <l1>1 tbsp salt</l1>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>about 2 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground paprika </li>
            <li>1 tbsp sundried tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp yeast extract paste</li>
            <li>2 blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

        <h4><em>YOU WILL NEED:</em></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>a 2-inch plain round cutter and a paintbrush</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>


        <h2>><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour, yeast, salt, oil, and almost all of the water in a large bowl and mix with a round-bladed knife to make a soft dough. Add the rest of the water if the dough feels dry and crumbly. Turn out onto a floured counter and knead for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Return to a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto the counter and cut off a third. Knead the paprika and tomato paste into the smaller portion on a floured counter. It'll become very sticky while you knead in the tomato paste, but will gradually become smooth and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Grease a large baking sheet. Set aside 11 oz of the plain dough and shape the remainder into an egg shape for the Ood's head. Place on the baking sheet so the pointed end of the dough is in one corner of the baking sheet, giving you plenty of room to assemble the rest of the Ood diagonally across the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Pull off a small piece of the tomato-flavored dough and roll it into a long thin sausage under the palms of your hands until about 10 inches long. Push down onto the main section of the head on the baking sheet so it overlaps by 2 1/2-3 inches. Curl the other end down toward the corner of the baking sheet. Make more tendrils in the same way, varying their length and thickness. You might not need all the tomato-flavored dough.</li>
        </ol>
