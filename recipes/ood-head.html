        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>This Ood might look rather revolting with their squidlike tendrils, but they can be delicious in bread form if properly baked. This is a fun family bread to make-- mildly spiced and tomatoey at one end and plain at the other. Don't worry too much about the shaping. If you get the eyes, ears, and tendrils in the right place, it ll look incredibly "Ood" like. If you've any dough leftover, shape it into balls and bake as mini bread rolls. Like most breads, this one freezes well too if you're planning a Doctor Who part and want to get ahead. Then all you need for you party are a few obliging Oods to hand out the drinks.</p>

        <h2>><u>Ingredients</u></h2>

        <h4><em>FOR THE COOKIE DOUGH:</em></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>about 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>3/4 cup + 2 tbsp or 1 3/4 sticks firm slightly salted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>3/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2 medium egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

        <h4><em>TO DECORATE:</em></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>3 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>3 oz milk chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>3 oz white chocolate, chopped tubes of writing icing in red, blue, yellow, white and green</li>
            <li>2 oz each of black, red, blue, white, cream, light and dark brown ready-to-roll icing confectioners' sugar, for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

        <h4><em>YOU WILL NEED:</em></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>A plastic food bag, 3 small paper pastry bags, or small plastic food bags, and a fine paintbrush
        </ul>

        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>


        <h2>><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour in a food processor and add the butter. Process until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the confectioners' sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla extract and process to a smooth dough. Wrap in a plastic food bag and chill for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured counter to 1/4 inch thickness and cut out the figure shapes using the template (BUY THE GODDAMN COOKBOOK, page 149) or a gingerbread man cutter. Space slightly apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the trimmings to make additional shapes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until pale golden around the edges. Leave on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rock to cool.
            </li>
            <li>To decorate, melt the three chocolates separately in small heatproof bowls. Do this in the microwave in short spurts or by resting the bowls, one at a time, over a small pan of gently simmering water. Pour each melted chocolate into a small paper pastry bag ans nip off the merest tip. You can also use small plastic food bags, spooning the chocolate into one corner, twisting the bag to push the chocolate into the corner, and snipping off the smallest tip. Use the three chocolates to pipe hair onto the figures.</li>
            <li>For the Doctor Who clothes you can either pipe outlines of jackets, pants, coats, and sweaters onto the cookies using writing icing or thinly roll out small pieces of ready-to-roll icing on a counter dusted with confectioners' sugar and cut out the shapes. For coats and jackets, you can use the cookie cutter or template as a guide, trimming the clothes to fit once you've made the basic shape with the cutter. Secure in place with a squeeze of icing from a tube. Add accessories such as hats, umbrellas, ties, bow ties, and scarves, securing in place with a dampened fine paintbrush.</li>
        </ol>
